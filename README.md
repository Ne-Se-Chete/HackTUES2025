# Vitalis
Vitalis is an embedded device with a cloud-powered health monitoring platform designed to provide real-time health insights from home medical sensors to healthcare professionals. It helps individuals track vital signs such as ECG, heart rate, and blood oxygen levels.

## Access the App
### üëâ https://app.vitalis.nesechete.com/

## ü©∫ How It Works
- Modular ECG Device: Our innovative ECG device can be used as a portable continuous 24/7 ECG sensor, detecting events such as heart issues during episodes like fainting. It can also be used as a home diagnostic tool, providing real-time monitoring of heart health in various scenarios.

- Multiple Vital Measurements: In addition to ECG, our device also tracks BPM (beats per minute), SpO2 (blood oxygen saturation), and integrates GPS for location tracking, giving a comprehensive overview of the user's health.

- Web App Integration: The web app visualizes sensor data. For elderly patients, the data can be displayed on a map to help doctors and relatives monitor their condition remotely. The app ensures the data is accessible and easy to interpret.

- Real-Time Feedback: Every patient is linked to a doctor, and the system provides AI-driven suggestions based on ECG analysis for early predictions of potential health issues. This helps healthcare professionals intervene quickly when necessary.
